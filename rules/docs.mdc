# Project documentation (INDEX.md)

Use **docs/INDEX.md** as the main entry point for project structure and module documentation.

- **Read** `docs/INDEX.md` (project root) when you need an overview of the codebase, entry points, or where things live. It describes the project, the stack, the INDEX.md convention, and links to module-level INDEX.md files.
- **When working in a directory**, check if it has an `INDEX.md` (e.g. `src/main/INDEX.md`, `src/main/agent/INDEX.md`, `src/renderer/INDEX.md`, `scripts/INDEX.md`, or subfolders like `src/main/agent/core/INDEX.md`). Use it to understand what the module does, what’s in it, and what can be used.
- **When adding or changing substantial code** in a functional unit or subfolder, create or update the relevant `INDEX.md` so it stays accurate (see the convention in docs/INDEX.md).

This keeps project docs consistent and gives you (and other agents) a single place to start: docs/INDEX.md.
